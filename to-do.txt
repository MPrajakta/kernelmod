run the following command:
	make
this generates a .ko file. my-module.ko(or filename.ko) along with a bunch of other files.

run the following command:
	sudo insmod my-module.ko
this command loads the module in the kernel

to verify the same, run the following command:
	lsmod
also run the following command:
	dmesg
or
	dmesg | grep "LOADING"

unload the module by running
	sudo rmmod my-module
verify the same with the following command:
	lsmod
verify the message printed with:
	dmesg

Note: printk() is used to print the messages instead of printf().
